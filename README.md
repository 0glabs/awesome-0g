# Awesome 0G [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of awesome 0G projects, tools, and resources

0G (Zero Gravity) is the first decentralized AI operating system, powering a rapidly growing ecosystem of decentralized AI applications and chains. By combining the fastest, infinitely scalable data availability layer, the most affordable decentralized storage system, and a flexible framework for inferences and finetuning, 0G enables resource-intensive AI applications to run on-chain with unparalleled performance and efficiency.
