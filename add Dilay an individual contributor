Since my efforts are about community development, here's what I can offer you:

Yesterday a new and very bright star called CentrifugeðŸ’« was lit up in the COSMOS eco-system

Centrifuge Platform is an open source cross-chain platform for creating quests and tasks in the Cosmos ecosystem. Using elements of gamification and cryptocurrencies, Centrifuge helps projects engage users and build an active community.

I'm an individual contributor, but I'm also a POSTHUMAN contributor and can arrange to have you added to Centrifuge for free. If you wish, I can help with quests, namely the development of tasks, and from your side you need to decide how you will reward polzolzovatelnye XP or $

In general friends, if you like this idea write me at any time, I am open to you. It's great to have you
